# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data using machine learning and exploratory data analysis to uncover key insights. It includes three main tasks:

---

## 📌 Project Tasks

### 1. ⭐ Predicting Restaurant Ratings
Developed machine learning models to predict restaurant ratings based on:
- Cuisine types
